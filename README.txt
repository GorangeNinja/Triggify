Triggify semi-automatically places teleport triggers above all the surfaces marked with a certain texture, it struggles with certain complex shapes, just delete those.

Some of the faces on the triggers are buggy you can fix it by going into 'Map > Check for problems: 'Fix all (of type).

Enjoy, GorangeNinja
